      "message": "One of the release jobs has failed, but the deb package was pushed in an earlier step. The root cause for the failure is that I did not correct copy and paste the commit hash (I had an extra \"i\" before \"b962fcf573174c812f5a6a349221d99837e081fc\"). \n\nI think as next step the release job would have actually created a \"1.2.5\" git tag similar to what we did manually already. At least thatâ€™s what happens on RMR side. And for that it would have needed the commit hash. Since the tag also exists, I think we do not need to retry (which would mean 1.2.6).",
